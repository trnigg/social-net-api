# social-net-api

(`social-net-api` - Module 18 Challenge)

A basic NoSQL backend for social network sites.

## Description

- This project is a simple API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
- It is written in JS using the [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime environment, and built on a a MongoDB database, leveraging [`Express.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express/v/4.18.2) for routing, and using the [`Mongoose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose/v/8.0.3) ODM.
  - Additionally, [`date-fns`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns/v/3.1.0) assists with formatting time-stamps.
- The use-case of this app would be to incorporate it with a suitable front-end. However, to install and test functionality, please follow the [installation](#installation) and [usage](#usage--demo) guides below.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before installing the application, please ensure you have installed [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) and `npm`.  
> Additionally, [`MongoDB`](https://www.mongodb.com/) is required to initialise and work with the database in your local environment.

3. Navigate to the directory using the console, or open it in an integrated terminal.
4. Enter `npm i` or `npm install` in your console or integrated terminal to retrieve and install the required dependencies and automatically create a folder to store these (`./node_modules`).

## Usage / Demo

### Usage

> [!NOTE]
> To test the API functionality, please be aware that you will need an API tool such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

1. While in the directory the project-files are stored in (see [Installation](#installation) above), enter `npm run start` in the console to start the local server.
2. With the server up and running, a number of calls can be made using your API client of choice. Please see the demo video below for examples of all the available requests.

## Tests

No tests have been written for this application.

## Roadmap / Known Bugs

Curently, there are no known bugs or [issues](https://github.com/trnigg/social-net-api/issues).

With more dev time in the future, there are a few additions required to the API/db-model before it can be used for something like a social-media site. These include:

- Password fields for users and password hashing.
- An improved system for adding friends bilaterelly, potentially uusing a "pending_friends" field or similiar.
- More validations and data-checks - for example, a user should ideally only be able to add a friends that the API/db recognises as a registered/valid user.
